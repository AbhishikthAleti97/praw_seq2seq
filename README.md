Program to scrape reddit data using reddit-api

Create an API using reddit account to scrape data,
enter the credentials in a new python credentials.py file,
run the program (change the limiters and other paramenters, if necessary).

Voila, you now have a dataset of your favorite subreddit. This program collects data in a certain format.

1st line is a comment,
2nd line is a reply to the 1st.

Each line represents a comment submission.
This program is optimal to train seq-seq chatbots.
